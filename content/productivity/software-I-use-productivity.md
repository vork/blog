I really love productivity tools. Mostly because I’m lazy and I like productivity. The perfect match for productivity software. Again I’m using a MacBook for work and so productivity matters most while working. So this stuff is mostly OS X based.

* [1Password](https://1password.com/):
Everyone should use a password manager. I’m using 1Password because it fits me.
* [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/):
Just try it. It improved my sleeping habits.
* [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/):
Nice looking, fast mail client which can handle different accounts really well. It even has an iOS app.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/):
Just plain awesome. From searching files to selecting music to play from spotify. Everything is better with it. Oh and it can let you search tabs in chrome.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/):
I’ve listed quite a lot of software here. Your menubar should be messy by now. This fixes it.
* [Deliveries](http://junecloud.com/software/mac/deliveries.html):
I get packets a lot. Most of them have tracking links. This software automatically fetches the tracking information. It even creates a calendar entry for the packet arrival date.
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical):
A calendar which uses natural language processing to create entries. Like: ‘Lunch with Pete at 1 pm’. It can integrate with alfred which makes creating of events super easy and fast.
* [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/):
Hard to explain. This thing can do everything. Really everything. I may even need to write some blog posts about it later. It really is that mighty.
* [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/):
Tiling Window Managers are awesome. Unfortunately there isn’t a feature in OS X. This is in my opinon one of the best tools to get a sort of tiling feature.
* [Numi](https://numi.io/):
Text based calculator. You can write values in variables and use them. Naming stuff is sometimes really helpful and it makes calculating better.
* [Paperless](http://marinersoftware.com/products/paperless/):
I’m kinda bad at keeping stuff organized. Finding a letter is sometimes really time consuming plus to be honest: Paper sucks. This suit in combination with a ScanSnap document scanner is awesome. I only keep important letters. The rest is just scanned in and categorized and thrown away. It really helped me getting a hold of my letter sorting.
* [PCalc](http://pcalc.com/):
Best calculator for OS X. It supports RPN. I guess I don’t need to add anything else.
* [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm):
Really good software for screen recording. Good quality. Nice to use. Me likes.
* [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander):
Guess what? This app expands text. Text you just typed anywhere on the Mac. You can even add some inputs for text to expand. For example if you need to often write the same mail to different people, you could just adjust the greetings.

I will most likely update these posts from time to time and mark the new items.
