So I'm working as Android Developer, I'm a computer science student and in the [design edition]({{< relref "design/software-I-use-design.md" >}}) of this series, I mentioned that I'm using a MacBook. So a lot of software here is OS X based and some Android specific programms are here too.
<!--more-->

* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/):
It’s a better terminal. Support for tabs, splitting, a Popover window mode and a ton of more features. If you’re using the terminal often, just download iTerm.
* [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en):
Let’s face it: the german keyboard layout sucks for programming. But using a qwerty keyboard sucks for writing in german, because you lose the german umlauts. This software allows it to map key combinations to lets say braces. cmd + ö/ä creates [ or ] and caps lock (which is mapped to ctrl) + ö/ä creates { or }. I remapped quite a lot of keys and it helps me with programming.
* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash):
Every developer knows the importance of documentation. Accessing documention everywhere and fast is super important. This app can download documentations and make them offline searchable. It integrates with alfred (see [productivity edition]({{< relref "productivity/software-I-use-productivity.md" >}})) and so searching through the documentations is just a few key strokes away.
* [Monodraw](http://monodraw.helftone.com/):
This tool makes drawing ASCII art easily. It's super useful for documenting source code in a more graphical way. Not really a app which is used every day, but for some cases it's awesome.
* [Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw):
I guess every developer heard about a REST Api. Testing these APIs can be quite painful. Some APIs love the usage of headers to pass parameters and calling a endpoint with a header with a browser only is quite annoying. Some APIs require an oauth authentification. For these cases Paw is saving yourself a lot of time and nerves.
* [StarUML](http://staruml.io/):
Most UML Software is terrible and I really hated creating UML diagramms. But this piece of software is really awesome. The UI even looks good. Mind blown.
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html):
I'm so glad the Android team switch from Eclipse to Intellij IDEA as a base IDE. It's the default for Android development and it's awesome.
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/) (but just install it via homebrew):
I don't want to offend the emacs people, but I like VIM way better. It's super fast and responsive and the key combination won't break your fingers.
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3):
For specific tasks I like Sublime better than VIM. I don't know why, but Sublime is super responsive too. A reason why I prefer Sublime over Atom.
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) & [Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/): The package manager for OS X. With homebrew you can install all the console programs you want and with cask you can install a huge number of GUI applications.

And again, I will update this post in the future with new apps and workflows.
