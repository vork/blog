A while ago I got interest in designing interfaces. I read a lot about it and it started as a hobby. Currently I'm working as a Android developer and Designer for a startup.

I started using Photoshop to design interfaces. It really was a terrible experience. Everything was pixel based and Android design has 5 screen densities. So every icon needed to be drawn 5 times.

I got annoyed and read about Sketch at this time. Needlessly to say I wanted to try it out. So I setup a Hackintosh, fell in love and now I'm working mainly on a MacBook. Yep sketch is that good. This is why the list is mostly OS X based.

* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/):
It's like Adobe Illustrator, but less expensive. With some amazing features and a nice crossover feature of pixel and vector workflow. I prefer Affinity Designer for more complex illustrations over Sketch.
* [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/):
Really nice Adobe Photoshop replacement. It even can process RAW files and export to PSD. It got some nifty features which aren't in Photoshop.
* [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com/mac), [Principle](http://principleformac.com/) & [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/):
Really good tools to mockup some animations and the general flow of the app. Marvel has a simpler scope than Flinto and Principle, but it's way quicker to create a mockup. So basic workflow: Design in Sketch, do a quick test in marvel and then do the finer details for critical parts in Flinto or Principle.
* [IconJar](http://geticonjar.com/):
If you design interfaces for a longer time, you most likely bought a few icon packs. Most likely you're drowning in icon packs. In this app you can import all icons and search them. Yeah search them. The app generates searchable tags based on the file name. Another useful feature: You can filter for vector or bitmap icons.
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/):
This app is as mentioned the reason why I've switched to OS X. It really changed my total interface design workflow. Everything is vector based and exporting to different screen densities is super easy. This is so good for Android design. And there are plugins which totally improve the whole app even more.
* [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/):
I work at a startup and I'm doing the work remotely. I'm the main designer, so I need to get my designs with exact measurments and color values to the iOS developer. This app does exactly these things. There's even a sketch integration.
* [Napkin](http://aged-and-distilled.com/):
As in the Zeplin part mentioned I'm working remotely and I send the designs via zeplin. After implemention I'm verifying the results. So I'm taking screenshot of screens with style bugs and for a better communication, I'm annotating the screenshots. This app makes it faster to annotate these screens than doing it in a 'normal' photo editing software.

This post will be updated with new apps and workflow changes in the future. I will most likely add a section for sketch plugins.
