Becoming a vegan meant quitting on lots of stuff. Like cheese and mayonnaise. But vegan cooking also meant creative cooking for me and finding ways to prepare a specific non vegan dish. So here is a vegan mayonnaise version.

## Ingredients

For 400ml of mayonnaise:

* 150ml soy milk
* 250ml oil
* 1 tsp mustard
* juice of a lemon
* 1/2 tsp salt
* pinch paprika, curcuma, Kala Namak, sugar

## Cooking

Add everything except the oil to a blender or wand blender. Combine everything for 30 seconds.

Slowly add the oil while blending until it thickens. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
