I really love roasted eggplant. I guess it's started with some falafel food places where you can add roasted eggplant to the falafel. With the parsley dip it's a great summer dish.

# Cooking

So we start with slicing the eggplant in slices (approx 1cm thick) and salt them from both sides. Let them sit for 5 minutes. In the meantime dice your onions, red pepper and finely dice the garlic.

Heat some oil in a pot and add the onions. Simultaneously heat some oil in a pan and start roasting the eggplants in small portions. Roast each side for approx 4 minutes.

When the onions are translucent add the garlic and let them simmer a bit. Afterwards add the broth, tomatoes, ajvar and rice. Season with the listed spices to taste. Add the red pepper and peas. Cook for 25 minutes and stir occasionally.

When all eggplant slices are done, let the remaining garlic simmer for a bit. Add the crushed tomatoes, eggplants and season with the listed spices. Heat everything.

While waiting for the rice and eggplants just add a huge amount of parsley to the soy yoghurt and season to taste.

That's it. Enjoy your meal.
