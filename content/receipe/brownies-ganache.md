Ok. Brownies are awesome. Add chocolate ganache and they’re even more awesome. Nothing for a strict diet, but definitely tasty.

## Ingredients

for 1 baking plate:

### Brownies
* 300g flour
* 300g sugar
* 3-4 tbsp. cocoa
* 2 tsp. baking soda
* 100g (vegan) margarine
* 360ml warm water
* 1 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice
* 1 pack vanilla sugar (8g)
* salt

### Ganache
* 200g vegan chocolate
* 200ml soy cream
* 2-3 tbsp. margarine

## Cooking

Melt the chocolate in a water bath. When the chocolate is molten stir in the soy cream and margarine. Remove from heat and let cool. Ideally in a fridge.

Preheat the stove to 180°C.  For the brownie dough mix all dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients while stirring. The dough should be firm and creamy. The consistency is similar to a muffin dough.

Spread the dough on a deep baking plate. Bake for 35 minutes. Test the brownies from time to time with a stick.

Take the ganache and whip it. If the ganache refuses to get creamy, add more margarine. When you have a nice, creamy ganache put it back in the fridge.

When the brownies are done, let them cool and spread the ganache afterwards evenly on the brownies.
