I guess this recipe is in the category: You can put everything is a wrap. So I wanted to try green asparagus in a wrap, because I'm kinda in love with green asparagus currently. It looks way fancier than the white one and you don't need to peel it. This is a huge bonus if you want a quick and tasty meal.

# Ingredients

For 6 Wraps:

* 6 large soft wraps

## Filling
* 400g green asparagus
* 300g cherry tomatoes
* 100g lamb's lettuce
* 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar
* olive oil
* salt, pepper

## Dip
* 400g soy yoghurt
* parsley
* 4 leaves bear leek
* 2 tbsp. nutritional yeast
* salt & pepper

# Cooking

Start with preheating the baking oven to 220Â°C. Then wash the asparagus and the cherry tomatoes. Slice off the white parts (if there are any) of the asparagus. Sometimes you need to peel off some thicker parts of the asparagus, but you're mostly fine with just cutting off the white parts.

Afterwards you slice the asparagus in 2-3cm long parts and slice the cherry tomato in halves. Put everything on a baking sheet and sprinkle with oil, pepper and salt. Put everything in the oven for about 10 minutes.

While the asparagus and tomatoes are roasting, slice the parsley, bear leek and mix everything with the remaining ingredients for the dip. Season with salt and pepper.

Wash and dry the lamb's lettuce. When the asparagus and tomatoes are done, mix them with the lamb's lettuce in a bowl and add the balsamic vinegar with 2 tbsp of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper.

Heat the wraps and spread the dip on the wraps. Then add the filling and roll the wraps. Enjoy your meal.
