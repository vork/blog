# Ingredients

For 2-3 persons:

## Lasagne
* 400g small potatoes
* 200g mushrooms
* 2 onions
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 can of kidney beans
* 1 can chickpeas
* 1 can corn
* 2 cans crushed tomatoes
* 300ml vegetable broth
* 2 tbsp. tomato paste
* Sugar, pepper, salt, cumin, oregano, marjoram
* oil
* wraps (the big one. I’ve used 3 wraps)

## Cheese topping
* 100g cashews
* 1 tbsp. tahini
* lemon juice

# Cooking

Let the cashews soak in water. Ideally overnight.

I like potatoes with skin. So I just washed the potatoes thoroughly. You can peel them if you want. Chop the potatoes in 1 cm cubes, cut the mushshrooms into slices, dice the onion and garlic. Drain the  chickpeas, kidney beans and corn.

Pick a big, deep pan and roast the potatoes in some oil.

Pick a cooking pot and add the onions. When the onions are translucent add the garlic and deglaze with the crushed tomatoes. Add 200ml broth and season with the listed spice to taste. Let everything simmer until thickend.

Preheat the stove to 180°C.

When the potatoes are done add the kidney beans, corn, chickpeas, the remaining broth and the tomato paste to the pan. Let everything cook for 5 minutes and add the shrooms. After 2-3 minutes season again and remove the pan from heat.

If you like your sauce creamy, you can blend the tomato sauce. I skipped this step.

Blend the cashews and add water until the mix has a cream cheese consistency. Add the tahini. Season with the lemon juice and salt.

Pick a baking dish, add some tomato sauce and top with a wrap. You may need to cut the wrap to fit the dish. Add another layer of tomato sauce and top with the filling. Add another layer of tomato sauce and continue until the baking dish is filled. The last layer should be a wrap layer with some tomato sauce on top. Add the cheese topping. You can create a nice grid pattern.

Bake everything for 25-30 minutes in the stove. Enjoy your meal.
